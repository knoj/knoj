- 🧙‍♂️ Hi, I’m @knoj
- 👁‍🗨 I like to code in: Python, C#, C++, HTML, CSS, & JS.  I use these tools mostly to build hardware/software interfaces for automation, prototyping, or adding fun features to my kit car.
- 🔰 I'm currently learning about the Arduino Pro & OPTA series.  My goal is to improve my automation skills to better serve manufacturers in Indiana.
