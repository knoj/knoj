- 👋 Hi, I’m @knoj
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, C#, C++, HTML, CSS, & JS.  I use these tools mostly to build hardware/software interfaces for automation, prototyping, or adding fun features to my kit car.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about any and everything I can!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Mondays only.
